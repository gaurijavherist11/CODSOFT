# ChatBuddy â€“ Rule-Based Chatbot

**Author:** Gaauri Javheri
**Internship:** CodSoft AI Internship

## Project Overview

ChatBuddy is a **simple rule-based chatbot** developed in Python. It interacts with users by responding to greetings, questions about itself, feelings, time, and other predefined queries using **pattern matching with regular expressions**.

This project demonstrates the basics of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using rule-based methods and provides a foundation to build more advanced chatbots.

## Features

* **Greeting Recognition:** Responds to "hi", "hello", or "hey".
* **Self-Introduction:** Answers questions like "who are you" or "your name".
* **Feelings:** Replies to "how are you" or "how do you feel".
* **Time Inquiry:** Provides a basic response for questions about time.
* **Purpose/Help:** Explains what the bot can do.
* **Exit Commands:** Users can type "bye", "exit", or "quit" to end the chat.
* **Fallback Response:** Provides a default message for unrecognized input.
* **Extensible:** Easy to add more rules in the `respond()` function.

## Technology Used

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** `re` (for regular expression pattern matching)

## How It Works

1. The chatbot prompts the user for input.
2. Input is processed and matched against predefined patterns using regular expressions.
3. If a match is found, the bot replies with the corresponding response.
4. If no match is found, a fallback response is shown.
5. The chat continues until the user types an exit command.

## Future Improvements

* Add **real-time clock and date** functionality.
* Include **jokes, quotes, or small talk**.
* Expand with **basic math calculations**.
* Integrate **AI/ML models** for smarter responses.
